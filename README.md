# Circle-Grid-Motion
This sketch created a grid of animated circle using p5.js.. Each circle genlly pulses in size and colour, producing a subtle and colour motion.
WHAT I LEARNED
How to use nested for loops to generate a gride layout
How to animate properties using sin() and frameCount().
How to use map() to convert sine wave output into RGB into colour values.
NEW TECHNIQUES USED
sin() and cos() for smooth oscillation
map() for dynamic colour mapping
frameCount() as part of the dynamic motion
