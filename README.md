#  Circle Grid Motion

##  Project Overview
This p5.js sketch creates a grid of animated circles that subtly pulse and shift color over time. Each circle responds to its position and the frame count, producing a dynamic and meditative visual effect.

##  What I Learned
- How to use nested `for` loops to build a grid layout
- How to animate properties using `sin()` and `frameCount`
- How to use `map()` to convert sine wave output into RGB color values
- How color motion and subtle animation can enhance generative art

## Techniques Used
- `createCanvas()` and `draw()` for animation
- `sin()` and `cos()` for smooth oscillation
- `map()` for dynamic color mapping
- `fill()` and `circle()` for rendering visuals

##  Creative Notes
I experimented with different animation speeds and color ranges to create a flowing rhythm across the canvas. Each circle behaves slightly differently based on its position, making the grid feel alive.

##  Next Steps
- Add mouse interactivity (e.g., hover effects or click-based changes)
- Explore Perlin noise for organic motion
- Try layering transparency or gradients
